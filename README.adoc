## Random Number Generator Service

This repository holds a sample REST service used in most of the https://github.com/k8spatterns/examples/[examples] for the book "Kubernetes Patterns" by https://github.com/bibryam[Bilgin Ibryam] and https://github.com/rhuss[Roland Hu√ü].

It's a simple Spring Boot service with a handful of endpoints used to demonstrate Kubernetes concepts.

You can start it locally with with `./mvnw -pl spring spring-boot:run` footnote:[Instead of the Maven wrapper `mvnw` you can also use a locally installed `mvn`] and get a random number:

[source, bash]
----
curl -sL http://localhost:8080/ | jq .
{
  "random": 838265052,
  "id": "58da4c5b-ba06-438e-84f8-1a30581baeb8"
}
----

In order to create a Docker image, just use `./mvnw -pl spring package docker:build`.
You can easly change the Docker repository and push it to your own account with `-Dimage.repo`:

[source, bash]
----
./mvnw -Dimage.repo="rhuss" package docker:build push
----

| many

| log.url
| LOG_URL
| If given, send out an HTTP request with the results of a random number generation
| Ambassador

| build.type
| BUILD_TYPE
| Add some informations about how the image has been built
| Image Builder

| pattern
| PATTERN
| Descriptive label used in environment variables
| Envvar Configuration, Configuration Resource

| seed
| SEED
| Seed number to initialize the random number generator. Must be a long.
| Configuration Resource

### Endpoints

[cols="1,5,2", options="header"]
|===
| Endpoint | Description | Pattern

| /
| Return a random number and a unique id of this service
| many

| /info
| Return information about configuration and system
| many

| /memory-eater
| Allocate an array for eating up heap memory. Use parameter "mb" to specify the size in MegaByte
| Predictable Demands

| /toggle-live
| Toggle the status of the Sprint Boot's actuator health check between `UP` and `DOWN`
| Health Probe

| /toggle-ready
| Add or remove the local file which indicates readiness of this service
| Health Probe

| /shutdown
| Shutdown the Spring Boot service
| Managed Lifecycle

| /logs
| Return the content of the logs
| Stateful Service, Init Container
|===

### Batch

There is also a single class `RandomRunner` included which creates a list of random numbers into a file:

[source, bash]
----
# Compile stuff first
./mvnw -pl spring compile

# Create a file with 100000 lines in /tmp/random_numbers.txt
java -cp target/classes RandomRunner /tmp/random_numbers.txt 100000

# Write 100000 lines to /dev/random_seed, wait 30s, and then repeat endlessly.
java -c target/classes RandomRunner /dev/random_seed 100000 30
----

This command is used in the _Batch Job_ and _Periodic Job_ pattern example.
The last example is used in _Daemon Service_ pattern example.

### Building

Refer to the _Image Builder_ pattern how this example is build from within a Kubernetes cluster.

For creating a tag `2.0` just use the profile `-Pv2`. This is used for creating images to be used the _Declarative Deployment_ pattern.

### Crossbuild the images

In order to compile the images for multiple architectures, use:

[source, bash]
----
docker buildx create --use
docker buildx build --build-arg VERSION="v1" --platform linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t k8spatterns/random-generator:1.0 .
docker buildx build --build-arg VERSION="v2" --platform linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t k8spatterns/random-generator:2.0 .
